    "# Machine Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "#### In this notebook we'll show the results of different preprocessing steps used on the data to predict falls using SVM models and Convolutional Neural Network models. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### SVMs were picked due to being the best model used to predict falls in research that uses similar types of data as us (sensor data instead of images or video).  The idea behind CNNs is that, if the data has some kind of pattern in terms of peak velocities or accelerations from different sensors, then CNNs will learn this better and faster than other models. In addition, we couldn't find any research on the use of CNNs for fall detection that wasn't time series analysis, so we decided to give it a try.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The notebook will be divided in 4 parts, each one using a different set of preprocessing steps. The first 3 use SVMs as the predictive model and the last one uses CNNs. The reason for this is that there is no clear definition on what a \"fall\" is, different research papers consider a \"fall\" as something different, everyone agrees that it starts with a loss of balance then a peak in acceleration, and at the end the acceleration and velocity stop when the person hits the ground, the problem is identifying this with sensor data. Some researchers use a X second window around the peak acceleration, for example.  We wanted to focus more on the effects of these preprocessing steps on the predictions as well as documenting these steps correctly, since we've found that most other researchers don't explain their preprocessing steps in a detailed manner.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### These steps involve mostly the definition of a \"fall\", as in, with these we'll set the targets of our machine learning algorithms  as fall or not fall (1 or 0) as well as pick or drop the columns of data that our models will use. Each section will have an explanation of these steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The models in this notebook use the set of hyperparameters that we found produced the best results.  Additionally, keep in mind that of the trials, and in those trials, about one third of the trial itself is an actual fall. Due to this, it's fairly easy to get high accuracy but not so easy to do a good job at actually predicting the falls themselves.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Additionally there is one last section for visualization on the results of different tests that we performed. It was done this way to avoid having to rerun the different parts of the program each time since some of them take a while to run."
